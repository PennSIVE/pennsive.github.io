If you just got cluster access, first setup your SSH keys:
```sh
ssh-keygen # if you've never done this or aren't sure; you can accept all the defaults, and don't need a passphrase
ssh-copy-id user@cluster
```

The [CBICA wiki](https://cbica-wiki.uphs.upenn.edu) (UPHS VPN required) is a good resource for CUBIC-specific tutorials, and [Ali's blog](https://www.alessandravalcarcel.com/blog/) offers lots of useful PMACS-specific information.

Also see the [PennLINC internal website](https://pennlinc.github.io) which offers many useful tutorials and tips.
