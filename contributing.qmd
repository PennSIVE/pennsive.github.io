# Contributing to this Wiki

Thank you for considering making a contribution to the PennSIVE wiki! In this article, you will find a streamlined set of steps that you will need to follow in order to contribute your own article to the PennSIVE wiki website.   
The requirements to follow this tutorial are: 

- A [GitHub account](https://github.com/join).  
- Have [Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/) installed (comes with the latest version of Rstudio).
- Have [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) installed.  
- Basic [markdown syntax](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) knowledge.  

In essence, making a contribution to this Wiki will involve writing or editing Markdown files and running a few git commands to integrate your changes with the existing wiki. Don't worry you got this! 

## 1. Fork and clone the wiki repo

The first step to collaborate on any project that is hosted on GitHub (e.g., this wiki) involves "forking". Forking a GitHub repository (or repo for short) allows you to create your own personal copy of a project under your GitHub account. This forking mechanism allows you to back up changes you make to this wiki's code without affecting the original repository. 

To fork this wiki's source code, follow these steps:  
1. Navigate to `https://github.com/pennsive/pennsive.github.io` while logged in to GitHub.  
2. Click `Fork` on the upper right hand corner. ![How to Fork](images/contributing/forking.png)  
  
After forking, you can check your personal copy of the wiki's source code under this URL: `https://github.com/<your-username>/pennsive.github.io`.  
3. Then, clone your copy of the repository from GitHub onto your local machine.  In a [Terminal](https://support.apple.com/guide/terminal/open-or-quit-terminal-apd5265185d-f365-44cb-8b09-71a064a42125/mac), run: 

```sh
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/pennsive.github.io
```

This will create a folder called `pennsive.github.io` at the location where you run this command.

## 2. Link your local copy to the `upstream` repository

GitHub allows you to have remote copies of your git repositories. By convention, your personal **remote** copy of a git repository is called `origin`. For projects you do not own (e.g., forked projects), there is one more remote copy that you should track: the original repository, which by convention is called `upstream`.  
To track the original PennSIVE wiki repository as the `upstream` repository, you can run:

```sh
cd pennsive.github.io # to get into the project folder
git remote add upstream https://github.com/pennsive/pennsive.github.io.git
```
